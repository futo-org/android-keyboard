# FUTO Keyboard

The goal is to make a good modern keyboard that stays offline and doesn't spy on you. This keyboard is a fork of [LatinIME, The Android Open-Source Keyboard](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/inputmethods/LatinIME), with significant changes made to it.

Check out the [FUTO Keyboard website](https://keyboard.futo.tech/) for downloads and more information.

## Issue tracking and contributing

Please check the GitHub repository to report issues: [https://github.com/futo-org/android-keyboard/](https://github.com/futo-org/android-keyboard/)

The source code is hosted on our [internal GitLab](https://gitlab.futo.org/keyboard/latinime) and mirrored to [GitHub](https://github.com/futo-org/android-keyboard/). As registration is closed on our internal GitLab, we use GitHub instead for issues and pull requests.

If you want to help translate the app, please do so via our Pontoon instance: https://i18n-keyboard.futo.org/

Due to custom license, pull requests to this repository require signing a [CLA](https://cla.futo.org/) which you can do after opening a PR. Contributions to the [layouts repo](https://github.com/futo-org/futo-keyboard-layouts) don't require CLA as they're Apache-2.0

Please do not submit AI-generated pull requests, as these tend to make the codebase more difficult to understand. Pull requests made with clear heavy use of AI may be closed without comment. Please also avoid using AI to write issues, and try to explain it in your own words instead.

## Layouts

## Building

### Git LFS is required

Some submodules (the swipe typing models in `java/assets/futo-swipe` and the voice input models in `voiceinput-shared/src/main/ml`) are hosted on Hugging Face and store their model files with git-lfs.

```
# macOS:
brew install git-lfs

# Debian/Ubuntu:
apt install git-lfs

# followed by
git lfs install
```

Download the real files:
```
git submodule foreach --recursive git lfs pull
```

### Cloning

When cloning the repository, you must perform a recursive clone to fetch all dependencies:
```
git clone --recursive https://gitlab.futo.org/keyboard/latinime.git
```

If you forgot to specify recursive clone, use this to fetch submodules:
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

You can then open the project in Android Studio and build it that way, or use gradle commands:
```
./gradlew assembleUnstableDebug
./gradlew assembleStableRelease
```

## APK signing

For official FUTO Keyboard versions, you can verify the APK's signing key fingerprint for integrity.

```

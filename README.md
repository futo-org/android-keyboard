# FUTO Keyboard

The goal is to make a good modern keyboard that stays offline and doesn't spy on you. This keyboard is a fork of [LatinIME, The Android Open-Source Keyboard](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/inputmethods/LatinIME), with significant changes made to it.

Check out the [FUTO Keyboard website](https://keyboard.futo.org/) for downloads and more information.

The source code is hosted on our [internal GitLab](https://gitlab.futo.org/keyboard/latinime) and mirrored to [GitHub](https://github.com/futo-org/android-keyboard/). As registration is closed on our internal GitLab, we use GitHub instead for issues and pull requests.

Due to custom license, pull requests to this repository require signing a [CLA](https://cla.futo.org/) which you can do after opening a PR. Contributions to the [layouts repo](https://github.com/futo-org/futo-keyboard-layouts) don't require CLA as they're Apache-2.0

## Building

When cloning the repository, you must perform a recursive clone to fetch all dependencies:
```
git clone --recursive https://gitlab.futo.org/keyboard/latinime.git
```

If you forgot to specify recursive clone, use this to fetch submodules:
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

You can then open the project in Android Studio and build it that way, or use gradle commands:
```
./gradlew assembleUnstableDebug
./gradlew assembleStableRelease
```

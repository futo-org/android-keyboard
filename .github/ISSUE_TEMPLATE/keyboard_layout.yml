        # Thank you for opening a keyboard layout request.

        The [android-keyboard](https://github.com/futo-org/android-keyboard) issue tracker is reserved for issues relating to the FUTO Keyboard Android Application

        For discussion related to enhancements, please see the [FUTO Keyboard Zulip Channel](https://chat.futo.org/#narrow/stream/53-Keyboard) or the [FUTO Keyboard Discord](https://keyboard.futo.org/discord)

        Please open requests one at a time. If you have 3 separate feature requests/bugs, do not combine them into one issue, this makes it really difficult to track and understand them.

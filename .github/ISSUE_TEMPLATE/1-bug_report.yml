        # Thank you for taking the time to fill out this bug report.

        The [android-keyboard](https://github.com/futo-org/android-keyboard) issue tracker is reserved for issues relating to the FUTO Keyboard Android Application

        For general usage questions, please see the [FUTO Keyboard Zulip Channel](https://chat.futo.org/#narrow/stream/53-Keyboard) or the [FUTO Keyboard Discord](https://keyboard.futo.org/discord)

        Please open bug reports one at a time. If you have 3 separate feature requests/bugs, do not combine them into one issue, this makes it really difficult to track and understand them.

        ## Filing a bug report

        To fix your issues faster, we need clear reproduction cases - ideally allowing us to make it happen locally.
        * Please include all needed context. For example, Device, OS, Application, any relevant settings.
        * If you've found a particular series of interactions can introduce buggy behavior, please label those steps 1-n with markdown

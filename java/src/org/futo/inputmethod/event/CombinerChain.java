/**
 * This class implements the logic chain between receiving events and generating code points.
 *
 * Event sources are multiple. It may be a hardware keyboard, a D-PAD, a software keyboard,
 * or any exotic input source.
 * This class will orchestrate the composing chain that starts with an event as its input. Each
 * composer will be given turns one after the other.
 * The output is composed of two sequences of code points: the first, representing the already
 * finished combining part, will be shown normally as the composing string, while the second is
 * feedback on the composing state and will typically be shown with different styling such as
 * a colored background.
